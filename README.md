## ðŸ’» About

[Lights Out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game)) is a game that consists of a 5 by 5 grid of lights. When the game starts, a random number or a stored pattern of 
these lights is switched on. Pressing any of the lights will toggle it and the adjacent lights. The goal of the puzzle 
is to switch all the lights off, preferably in as few button presses as possible.
